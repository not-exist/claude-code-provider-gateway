# Getting Started

> From zero to running Claude Code through CCPG in under two minutes.

## Prerequisites

**For users (desktop app):**

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Operating system | macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel), Linux (x86_64 or ARM64), or Windows (x86_64) |
| Claude Code | Installed and runnable as `claude` from your shell |
| Disk space | ~200 MB for the installed app |

**For users (Docker/Web mode):**

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Docker | Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2 |
| Claude Code | Installed on the host if you want to launch Claude Code through the gateway |
| Disk space | A small named Docker volume for SQLite state |

**For source development:**

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | `>= 24.0.0` |
| npm | Ships with Node.js; workspaces required |
| Bun | `>= 1.3.14` (for daemon binary compilation) |
| Rust toolchain | Required for desktop builds |
| Tauri system dependencies | See [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS |

## Installation Steps

### Desktop App (Recommended)

1. Download the latest installer for your platform from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/danielalves96/claude-code-provider-gateway/releases):

   | Platform | Installer |
   |---|---|
   | macOS | `.dmg` (Apple Silicon or Intel) |
   | Linux | `.deb`, `.rpm`, or `.AppImage` |
   | Windows | `.msi` or `-setup.exe` |

2. Install and open the app. The daemon starts automatically.

3. Open the **Providers** tab, configure at least one built-in provider or add a custom OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible provider, and click **Test** to verify the connection works.

4. Go to **Dashboard -> Terminal Integration** and install the `ccpg` shell command. Follow the setup wizard for your shell (zsh, bash, or fish).

5. Relaunch your terminal so the new `ccpg` function takes effect.

### Docker/Web App

Docker/Web runs the same panel and daemon in a container and opens the UI in
your browser. It is useful when you do not want to install the desktop app.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielalves96/claude-code-provider-gateway.git
cd claude-code-provider-gateway
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open `http://localhost:6767` in your browser.

Docker/Web publishes:

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Panel UI and panel API | `http://localhost:6767` |
| OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible gateway | `http://localhost:49250/v1` |

State is persisted in the `ccpg_data` volume. For ports, environment variables,
Terminal Integration, backups, reverse proxy setup, and troubleshooting, see the
[Docker/Web Guide](DOCKER.md).

In Docker/Web mode, **Terminal Integration** cannot auto-install into your host
shell because the daemon runs inside the container. Open **Dashboard -> Terminal
Integration**, copy the manual command for your shell, and run it in a terminal
on the host system.

To stop the container:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To remove persisted Docker/Web state as well:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### Source Development

For contributors who want to run from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielalves96/claude-code-provider-gateway.git
cd claude-code-provider-gateway
npm install
npm run dev:desk
```

This starts the desktop app with hot-reload daemon, panel Vite dev server, and
Tauri window. See [Development](DEVELOPMENT.md) for the full guide.

## First Run

Once the app is open and you have at least one provider configured and tested, launch Claude Code through CCPG:

```bash
ccpg --DeepSeek
```

Replace `--DeepSeek` with the provider flag matching your configured provider (e.g., `--OpenRouter`, `--Ollama`, `--Copilot`, `--OpenAIAccount`) or with `--<custom-provider-slug>` for a custom provider. Any arguments after the provider flag are passed through to Claude Code:

```bash
ccpg --OpenRouter --resume <session-id>
ccpg --Ollama --continue
```

To see all available models across every enabled provider in Claude Code's model picker:

```bash
ccpg --all
```

## Use OpenAI-Compatible Clients

With the app running, open **OpenAI Gateway** in the sidebar to copy:

- Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:49250/v1`
- API key: the generated `sk_...` gateway token
- Model IDs from the active model picker, such as `<provider>/<model>`
- Ready-to-run curl examples for `/v1/models` and `/v1/chat/completions`

This path is for tools such as Cursor, Codex, OpenAI SDK clients, or any app that accepts an OpenAI-compatible base URL. It does not change the Claude Code flow: Claude Code still uses `ccpg` and the Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages` endpoint.

> [!WARNING]
> If your `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` has an `env` block with `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, **remove those entries before launching via `ccpg`**. Those env vars override the gateway endpoint and prevent CCPG from routing requests correctly.

## Common Setup Issues

### Claude Code is not routing through CCPG

Your `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` may contain conflicting environment variables. Remove any `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` entries from the `env` block. Then restart your terminal and run `ccpg --<provider>` again.

### `ccpg` says the gateway is not running

The desktop app must be open. The daemon runs as part of the app and shuts down when you close it. Open CCPG first, then run the `ccpg` command.

### Provider test fails

Common causes and fixes:

| Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| Provider is disabled | Enable it in the **Providers** tab. |
| Missing API key | Add or replace the API key in the provider modal. |
| OAuth token expired | Log out and sign in again from the provider card. |
| Wrong base URL | Restore the default URL or check your local server address. |
| Custom provider compatibility mismatch | Recreate the provider with the correct **Add OpenAI Compatible** or **Add Anthropic Compatible** action. |
| Network restriction | Configure **Settings → Outbound Proxy** and restart CCPG. |
| Empty model list | Add models manually in the provider modal. Custom providers always expose **Manual models**. |

For local providers, make sure the upstream server is running:

- **Ollama:** `http://localhost:11434`
- **LM Studio:** `http://localhost:1234/v1` (with server enabled)
- **llama.cpp:** `http://localhost:8080/v1`

### Model picker shows stale providers or models

`ccpg` clears Claude Code's gateway model cache during launch, but occasionally the cache may persist. Close Claude Code and delete the cached file:

```bash
rm ~/.claude/cache/gateway-models.json
```

Then run the launch command again.

### OpenAI Account OAuth fails with a region error

If you see `unsupported_country_region_territory`, configure an HTTP/HTTPS outbound proxy in **Settings → Outbound Proxy** and restart CCPG. OAuth token exchange, provider API calls, and model catalog fetches all use the outbound proxy when enabled.
