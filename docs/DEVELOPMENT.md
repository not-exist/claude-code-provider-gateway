# Development Guide

> How to set up, run, test, and build Claude Code Provider Gateway from source.

CCPG is distributed as a desktop app. npm, Bun, Rust, and Tauri are development/build tools, not the intended end-user installation path.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 24
- **npm** with workspaces
- **Bun** >= 1.3.14 (for daemon binary compilation)
- **Rust toolchain** (required for desktop development/builds)
- **Tauri system dependencies** (required for desktop development/builds — see [Tauri docs](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/))
- **Claude Code** installed as `claude` if you want to test the full gateway loop

## Quick Start

Desktop development is the main path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielalves96/claude-code-provider-gateway.git
cd claude-code-provider-gateway
npm install
npm run dev:desk
```

This starts the desktop app, a Vite panel dev server, and an external hot-reload daemon.

### Daemon + Panel Only

For lower-level daemon/panel work without opening Tauri:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts two processes concurrently via `concurrently`:

| Process | Command | Port | Hot Reload |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Daemon** | `nodemon --exec tsx packages/daemon/src/index.ts` | 49250 (proxy) + 6767 (panel) | Yes (nodemon) |
| **Panel** | `vite packages/panel` | 5173 | Yes (Vite HMR) |

The Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` requests to the daemon on `127.0.0.1:6767`.

### Desktop Development Details

```bash
npm run dev:desk
```

This starts three processes:
1. **Daemon** — with `CC_GATEWAY_EXTERNAL_DAEMON=1` flag
2. **Tauri dev** — opens a native window pointing to `localhost:5173`
3. **Panel Vite dev server** — serves the React app with HMR

In this mode the daemon runs externally, not as a Tauri sidecar, for faster iteration. Production builds bundle the daemon as a sidecar.

## Package Details

### Daemon (`packages/daemon/`)

Core proxy daemon. TypeScript compiled with tsup.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run build -w @claude-code-provider-gateway/daemon` | Build ESM bundle to `dist/` |
| `npm run dev -w @claude-code-provider-gateway/daemon` | Watch mode rebuild |
| `npm run compile:all -w @claude-code-provider-gateway/daemon` | Cross-compile daemon binary via Bun (all 5 platforms) |
| `npm run compile:linux-x64 -w @claude-code-provider-gateway/daemon` | Single-platform binary |

Key dependencies: Hono (web framework), `@hono/node-server` (Node adapter), `js-tiktoken` (token counting), `undici` (HTTP client).

### Panel (`packages/panel/`)

React SPA built with Vite.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run build -w @claude-code-provider-gateway/panel` | Production build to `packages/daemon/dist/static/` |
| `npm run dev -w @claude-code-provider-gateway/panel` | Vite dev server with HMR |

Key dependencies: React 19, React Router 7, Ant Design 5, Zustand 5.

**Important:** Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to `127.0.0.1:6767` (not `localhost` — on Linux, `localhost` can resolve to IPv6 `::1` while the daemon binds IPv4).

### Desktop (`packages/desktop/`)

Tauri v2 app (Rust). The daemon is compiled via Bun and bundled as a Tauri sidecar.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run prepare-sidecar -w @claude-code-provider-gateway/desktop` | Compile daemon binary for host platform, copy to Tauri binaries/ |
| `npm run dev -w @claude-code-provider-gateway/desktop` | `tauri dev` (requires sidecar prepared) |
| `npm run build -w @claude-code-provider-gateway/desktop` | Production desktop build (deb+rpm on Linux, DMG on macOS, MSI on Windows) |
| `npm run build:appimage -w @claude-code-provider-gateway/desktop` | AppImage bundle (Linux only) |

The `prepare-sidecar.mjs` script auto-detects the host platform and compiles the daemon binary accordingly.

#### Rust module layout

The Rust crate is intentionally small. Keep the desktop shell as orchestration code around the TypeScript daemon, not a second application backend.

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/lib.rs` | Tauri builder composition, plugin registration, app setup, sidecar autostart, and best-effort shutdown on exit |
| `src/commands.rs` | Public Tauri command boundary used by the React panel |
| `src/daemon_supervisor.rs` | Sidecar lifecycle: start, stop, status, stdout/stderr draining, stale PID cleanup |
| `src/tray.rs` | System tray/menu bar behavior: hide-on-close, show/hide actions, and intentional quit handling |
| `src/external_url.rs` | Allowlisted external URL validation and OS browser opening |
| `src/master_key.rs` | OS keychain integration for the 32-byte daemon secret key |
| `src/config.rs` | Environment variable names and desktop runtime flags |

Rust commands should return structured command errors from `commands.rs` instead of raw strings. Internal operations can use `anyhow` for context; typed errors are preferred at module boundaries where the panel may need stable error codes.

#### Desktop runtime modes

There are two daemon ownership modes:

| Mode | How it is selected | Who owns the daemon |
|---|---|---|
| External dev daemon | `CC_GATEWAY_EXTERNAL_DAEMON=1` | The npm dev process starts the daemon for hot reload |
| Sidecar daemon | Default production/dev Tauri path | Rust starts and supervises the bundled sidecar |

In external daemon mode, Rust intentionally refuses `start_daemon`/`stop_daemon`; the panel should treat the daemon as managed by the dev watcher. In sidecar mode, Rust obtains the master key from the OS keychain, passes it to the daemon via `CC_GATEWAY_SECRET_KEY`, drains sidecar output into logs, and stops the sidecar when the desktop app exits.

Closing the main desktop window should keep the app running in the background. For lifecycle work, validate both paths: the window close button hides the window, while tray/menu bar `Quit` performs a real app exit and stops the sidecar through the normal shutdown hook.

#### Desktop validation

Run Rust checks from `packages/desktop/src-tauri`:

```bash
cargo check
cargo test
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

If `cargo fmt` or `cargo clippy` reports that the component is missing, install the standard Rust components:

```bash
rustup component add rustfmt clippy
```

The desktop crate has focused unit tests for security-sensitive pure functions such as URL allowlisting and key material validation. Prefer adding tests around pure policy code before reaching for full Tauri integration tests.

## Testing

```bash
npm run quality:ci # Biome format + lint + import ordering, CI mode
npm run quality    # Biome check for local feedback
npm run quality:fix # Biome safe fixes and formatting
npm test          # Node built-in test runner (all daemon tests)
npm run typecheck # tsc --noEmit across daemon + panel (no emit, just type errors)
```

Tests use Node.js built-in test runner (`node --test`). Test files are co-located with source using `.test.ts` suffix:

```
src/config/validation.test.ts
src/config/secrets/config-splitter.test.ts
src/proxy/providers/shared/api-client.test.ts
src/proxy/services/messages/message-service.test.ts
...
```

The daemon has the broadest test suite. The desktop crate also has focused Rust unit tests for pure policy code. The panel package does not have a dedicated test suite yet.

### Token saver development

Token savers live in `packages/daemon/src/proxy/token-savers/` and are applied by `MessageService` before provider dispatch.

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `rtk/index.ts` | Compress large `tool_result` text blocks — orchestrates auto-detection and filter dispatch. |
| `rtk/filters.ts` | The 10 compression filters (git-diff, git-status, grep, find, ls, tree, dedup, truncate, etc.) and `autoDetectFilter`. |
| `caveman.ts` | Inject terse-response guidance into the Anthropic `system` prompt. |

RTK should only mutate safe tool-result payloads. Preserve errored tool results, skip tiny payloads, and keep the original text whenever compression fails or expands the content. Caveman should remain a config-driven system prompt injection; it should not touch message content.

Useful checks:

```bash
cd packages/daemon
node --import tsx --test src/proxy/token-savers/token-savers.test.ts
npm run typecheck
```

Manual validation path:

1. Start the app with `npm run dev:desk`.
2. Enable **Settings -> Token Savers -> RTK compression**.
3. Launch Claude Code through `ccpg --<provider>`.
4. Ask Claude Code to run a command with large output, such as `rg` or `git diff`.
5. Check daemon logs for an `rtk` line showing bytes saved.

Caveman can be validated with a normal chat request after enabling **Caveman mode**. The session prompt should include the injected terse-response guidance, and responses should become shorter according to the selected level.

### Model Chain development

Model Chains touch daemon config, model discovery, launch preparation, routing,
message fallback, session labels, and the panel editor. The main files are:

| Area | Files |
|---|---|
| Config schema and normalization | `packages/daemon/src/config/schema.ts`, `packages/daemon/src/config/validation.ts` |
| Launch modes and shell commands | `packages/daemon/src/panel/services/launch-prepare.ts`, `packages/daemon/src/panel/routes/shell-routes.ts` |
| Model catalog and routing | `packages/daemon/src/proxy/services/models/model-service.ts`, `packages/daemon/src/proxy/model-router.ts` |
| Runtime fallback execution | `packages/daemon/src/proxy/services/fallback/fallback-stream.ts`, `packages/daemon/src/proxy/services/fallback/fallback-target.ts` |
| Session history labels | `packages/daemon/src/runtime/sessions/index.ts`, `packages/daemon/src/runtime/sessions/types.ts` |
| Panel UI | `packages/panel/src/features/model-chain/`, dashboard quick-launch components |

Useful focused checks:

```bash
cd packages/daemon
node --import tsx --test src/proxy/services/models/model-service.test.ts src/proxy/services/messages/message-service.test.ts src/panel/services/launch-prepare.test.ts
npm run typecheck
```

Manual validation path:

1. Start the desktop dev app with `npm run dev:desk`.
2. Enable and test at least two providers.
3. In **Providers**, make sure the target models are enabled or manually added.
4. Open **Model Chain** and create a chain with a name, slug, and two or more
   ordered targets.
5. Run `ccpg --<chain-slug>` and verify Claude Code sees only that chain.
6. Run `ccpg --ModelChain` and verify Claude Code sees all enabled chains and
   no raw provider models.
7. Run `ccpg --all` and verify Claude Code sees enabled chains plus prefixed
   provider models.
8. Force the first target to fail, for example by disabling credentials or using
   a bad model id, and verify the request retries/falls through to the next
   target.
9. Inspect **History** to confirm the session command and model labels match
   the launch mode.

### Provider development

Provider source of truth lives in the daemon:

- `packages/daemon/src/config/schema.ts` — controls provider IDs, defaults,
  labels, OAuth membership, CLI flags, and panel settings defaults. Adding a new
  built-in provider ID or changing its defaults starts here.
- `packages/daemon/src/proxy/providers/registry.ts` — **the authoritative
  registry for provider construction**. Declarative factory registration via
  this registry is the preferred way to add a provider. Most providers can be
  fully expressed as a registry entry without a dedicated implementation file.
  Runtime custom providers are also constructed here from
  `config.providers.<slug>.custom.compatibility`.
- `packages/daemon/src/proxy/providers/` — provider implementation files.
  Create a dedicated file here **only** for non-declarative or edge-case
  behavior (custom stream handling, bespoke auth logic, dual-transport dispatch,
  etc.) that cannot be expressed through a registry/factory declaration.

Panel provider support is intentionally thinner:

- `packages/panel/public/providers/` for provider icons.
- `packages/panel/src/features/providers/domain/constants.ts` for local, OAuth,
  device-flow, and coming-soon grouping.
- `packages/panel/src/features/providers/data/suggestedModels.ts` for manual
  model suggestions when discovery is missing or incomplete.
- `packages/panel/src/features/providers/domain/apiKeyLinks.ts` for key-management
  shortcuts.
- `packages/panel/src/features/providers/domain/oauthPresentation.ts` for OAuth copy
  and provider-specific sign-in presentation.
- Custom provider UI lives in `packages/panel/src/features/providers/components/config/AddCustomProviderModal.tsx`
  plus the Providers page tab actions. Custom provider logos are uploaded to the
  daemon config directory instead of `packages/panel/public/providers/`.

Useful focused checks while working on providers:

```bash
npm test --workspace @claude-code-provider-gateway/daemon
npm run typecheck
```

For a single daemon test file:

```bash
cd packages/daemon
node --import tsx --test src/proxy/providers/commandcode/index.test.ts
```

Manual provider validation path:

1. Start the desktop dev app with `npm run dev:desk`.
2. Open **Providers**.
3. Search for the provider, configure auth or base URL, and click **Test**. For
   a runtime custom provider, use **Add OpenAI Compatible** or **Add Anthropic
   Compatible**, test discovery in the creation modal, then save it.
4. Check the model list and disable any models that should not be exposed.
5. Launch Claude Code with the provider flag, or use `ccpg --all` to validate
   gateway-prefixed routing.
6. If the provider should participate in Model Chains, create a chain using one
   of its enabled models and validate `ccpg --<chain-slug>`.
7. Inspect **History** and daemon logs for routed model, provider errors,
   prompt serialization, and response previews.

## Build Pipeline

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

This runs:
1. `cd packages/panel && npm run build` — builds React app to `packages/daemon/dist/static/`
2. `cd packages/daemon && npm run build` — bundles daemon TypeScript to `packages/daemon/dist/`

### Full desktop build

```bash
npm run build -w @claude-code-provider-gateway/desktop
```

On Linux this runs `tauri build --bundles deb,rpm` followed by the AppImage builder script.

## Distribution Model

The repository root is marked `"private": true`. CCPG is not currently published to npm as an end-user package.

End-user releases are desktop installers produced by the Tauri build pipeline:

- macOS: `.dmg`
- Linux: `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`
- Windows: `.msi`

## CI/CD

There are two GitHub Actions workflows:

### Quality Gate (`.github/workflows/quality.yml`)

Runs on every PR touching `packages/daemon`, `packages/panel`, `packages/desktop`, or `docs`. Also available via manual dispatch.

Three parallel jobs:

**Biome** (`ubuntu-22.04`):
1. `npm ci`
2. `npm run quality:ci -- --reporter=github --diagnostic-level=error` — format, lint, and import-order validation

**TypeScript** (`ubuntu-22.04`):
1. `npm ci`
2. `npm test` — Node built-in test runner
3. `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit` across daemon and panel
4. `npm run build` — full panel + daemon bundle

**Rust** (`ubuntu-22.04`):
1. Install Tauri Linux system dependencies
2. `cargo fmt --check`
3. `cargo check`
4. `cargo test`
5. `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`

### Desktop Build (`.github/workflows/desktop-build.yml`)

- **Triggers:** tag push (`v*`), PRs touching daemon/panel/desktop, manual dispatch
- **Matrix:** 5 targets (macOS ARM64, macOS Intel, Linux x86_64, Linux ARM64, Windows x86_64)
- **Builds:**
  - macOS: DMG (via `tauri-action`)
  - Linux: deb + rpm + AppImage (via custom build script)
  - Windows: MSI (via `tauri-action`)
- **Release:** on tag push, uploads all artifacts to a draft GitHub Release

## Debugging with Claude Code

```bash
# Get your auth token from ~/.config/claude-code-provider-gateway/config.json
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=sk_xxxxxxxxxxxx \
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:49250 \
CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1 \
claude
```

The `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1` flag is required for Claude Code v2.1.126+.

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a new provider

Use the provider checklist in [Adding a Provider](ADDING_PROVIDER.md). Short
version:

1. Prefer a runtime custom provider from the UI when the endpoint is plain
   OpenAI Chat Completions-compatible or Anthropic Messages-compatible.
2. For a new built-in provider, add it to `config/schema.ts`, register it in
   `ProviderRegistry`, add icon/panel metadata as needed, and add focused daemon
   tests before opening the PR.
3. Create `packages/daemon/src/proxy/providers/<provider>.ts` only when the
   provider needs custom auth, catalog, request conversion, streaming, or
   protocol dispatch that cannot be expressed by the shared transports.

### Adding a panel API endpoint

1. Add the response type to `packages/daemon/src/panel/types.ts`.
2. Add the route handler to the appropriate file in `packages/daemon/src/panel/routes/` (or create a new one and register it in `app.ts`).
3. Add the corresponding API client call in `packages/panel/src/shared/api/`.
4. Connect to the React component.

### Building the daemon binary

```bash
npm run compile:all -w @claude-code-provider-gateway/daemon
```

Output goes to `packages/daemon/dist-bin/`. The binary is a standalone executable compiled by Bun — no Node.js required at runtime.

## Editor Setup

The project uses TypeScript strict mode with ES2022 target and NodeNext module resolution. Ensure your editor respects the workspace `tsconfig.json`.

Relative imports **must** include the `.js` extension (ESM requirement):

```typescript
// Correct
import { loadConfig } from './config/index.js'

// Incorrect
import { loadConfig } from './config/index'
```

## Build Commands

Root workspace scripts (run from the repo root):

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | Production build: panel → daemon bundle |
| `npm run dev` | Start daemon (nodemon) + panel (Vite) for web-only dev |
| `npm run dev:desk` | Start daemon + panel + Tauri desktop shell with external daemon mode |
| `npm run dev:daemon` | Start daemon alone with nodemon hot reload |
| `npm run dev:panel` | Start panel alone with Vite HMR |
| `npm run test` | Run all daemon tests (Node built-in test runner) |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run `tsc --noEmit` across daemon and panel |
| `npm run quality` | Run Biome check (format + lint + import ordering) |
| `npm run quality:fix` | Run Biome check with safe auto-fixes |
| `npm run quality:ci` | Run Biome in CI mode (errors only, no writes) |
| `npm run format` | Run Biome formatter with auto-fix |
| `npm run format:check` | Run Biome formatter in check-only mode |
| `npm run lint` | Run Biome linter |
| `npm run lint:fix` | Run Biome linter with safe auto-fixes |
| `npm run lint:fix:unsafe` | Run Biome linter with unsafe auto-fixes |

Per-workspace scripts are documented under [Package Details](#package-details).

## Code Style

This project uses **Biome** (v2.4.x) as the single tool for formatting, linting, and import organization. There is no ESLint or Prettier — Biome replaces both.

### Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `biome.jsonc` | Root Biome configuration (formatter, linter, assist) |

Key settings:

- **Indent:** 2 spaces
- **Quotes:** double
- **Semicolons:** always
- **Trailing commas:** always (JS/TS), none (JSON)
- **Line width:** 100 characters
- **Line endings:** LF only
- **Target:** ES2022, strict TypeScript

Linter rules include recommended defaults plus `noUnusedImports` (error), `noUnusedVariables` (error), `noConsole` (warn), `noDebugger` (error), and `noExplicitAny` (warn, relaxed in test files).

### Running locally

```bash
npm run quality         # Check format + lint + imports (no changes)
npm run quality:fix     # Auto-fix safe issues
npm run format          # Format only (writes changes)
npm run lint            # Lint only (no changes)
```

CI runs `npm run quality:ci` which exits non-zero on any violation. Run the same command before pushing to avoid CI failures.

### IDE integration

Install the [Biome VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) and set it as the default formatter. The extension reads `biome.jsonc` automatically. Disable any conflicting ESLint/Prettier extensions in this workspace.

## Branch Conventions

The default branch is `master`. Feature and fix branches use lowercase slug prefixes:

| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `feat/` | New features or enhancements | `feat/redesign-providers-page` |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes | `fix/incomplete-tool-use-block` |
| `chore/` | Maintenance, tooling, build config | `chore/setup-biome-quality-gate` |

Branch names should be short, descriptive, and use hyphens between words. No ticket-number prefixes are required.

## PR Process

There is no PR template in the repository. The following guidelines are documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md):

1. **Before opening:** Ensure the change fits one of these categories — bug fix, provider compatibility improvement, desktop UX improvement, security/reliability/observability improvement, focused documentation, or tests for existing behavior. Large rewrites, new provider families, persistence changes, and security-sensitive changes should start as an issue or discussion.

2. **Run the quality gate:** Execute `npm run quality:ci`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, and `npm run typecheck` locally before pushing.

3. **Test your changes:** For daemon changes, run focused tests. For UI changes, include manual verification notes and screenshots/recordings where practical.

4. **Update documentation:** When modifying provider behavior, routing, config, storage, or release behavior, update the relevant docs (`PROVIDERS.md`, `ADDING_PROVIDER.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, etc.).

5. **Security:** Do not include real API keys, OAuth tokens, access tokens, or generated config files in the PR.

6. **Review:** A maintainer will review the PR. CI must pass (Quality Gate workflow) before merging. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for provider-specific PR requirements and the full checklist.
